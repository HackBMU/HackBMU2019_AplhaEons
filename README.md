Recommendation system based on course chosen by any user

Nowadays, choosing courses and working on them is quite peaky as there are alotof online courses available on the internet. This creates a confusion of what to choose, whether it should be paid or free; or certified or not. 
All this can be solved on the basis of ratings of students who took the course.

So, a recommendation system to help guide the students to choose what courses are the best for them, is implemented in an Android Application.
