Recommendation system based on course chosen by any user

Nowadays, choosing courses and working on them is quite pesky as there are a lot of online courses available on the internet. This creates a confusion of what to choose, whether it should be paid or free; or certified or not. 
All this can be solved on the basis of ratings of courses.

So, a recommendation system to help guide the students to choose what courses are the best for them, is implemented in an Android Application.

Beta version of the final application that we were able to make (Follow WhatULike).
